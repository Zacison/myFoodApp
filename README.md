# myFoodApp

This is a JS food app I made

In this project, you can search for food, select a recipe, add the ingredients to a shopping cart, and also add the recipe to your liked recipes. 

To do this, I used MVC architecture, and broke each of the models/views down into separate files for ease of use. 

I used AJAX calls using the fetch API & axios to get the data. 

Once that data is displayed on the left, you can click on a recipe to see the full recipe with ingredients. 

I used another API call to do that. 

I also implemented persistent storage for this application as well.
